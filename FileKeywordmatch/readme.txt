This Api is used for read line numbers for provided word in file 1 in file 2

For example :
Input file 1 contains names and other strings.
Input file 2 contains a list of names, one name per line.

Take these 2 files as input and print to standard out the line numbers from file 1 where the name in file 2 is found. For example, if file 2 contains the name Alice, expected output would be Alice: 4, 56, 200. This means in file 1, the name Alice appears in the file on line 4, 56, and 200.
